This is especially important in propeller aircraft and marine vehicles where turbulence is generated from appendages on the vehicle's body. This self-generated turbulence travels downstream and is eventually drawn into the propeller and produces noise. The broad study that the present work is a part of is concerned with understanding this ingestion noise problem so that the interaction can be better modeled and the sound produced can be predicted. To predict the sound produced by a fan or propeller ingesting turbulence, detailed information about the inflow condition is needed. In the present study the turbulence structure of the wake shed by a circular cylinder at 20 meters per second. The two-point velocity correlation in the wake serves as the complete inflow condition for the turbulence ingestion problem. The structure of the cylinder wake inflow condition was compared with the structure of an airfoil wake to evaluate how the differences in the two flows would influence the sound produced by a rotor ingesting the two conditions. The two flows were found to be quite similar in the mean flow. The cylinder wake was found to be significantly more turbulent than the airfoil wake and was correlated over greater distances. This suggests that the structures in the cylinder wake are larger and remain coherent longer than those in the airfoil wake. The average instantaneous velocity fields were estimated in both wake flows and showed that the structures in the cylinder wake were significantly different from the structures in the airfoil wake. These flow structure comparisons show why the differences seen in the turbulence profiles and two-point correlations exist.\"\n            ],\n            \"title\": \"Abstract: General Audience\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"paragraphs\": [\n                \"I would first like to thank my parents for their continued support throughout my undergraduate and graduate careers.

Measurements were performed on an untripped cylinder wake at a Reynolds number based on the cylinder diameter and freestream velocity of 60 000. The majority of the measurements were performed in the mid-wake region 20 diameters downstream of the cylinder center. These measurements were made to provide the inflow boundary condition to a larger study, described by , where the sound radiated by an open rotor due to the ingestion of the cylinder wake was studied. The four-dimensional space-time correlation of the wake at the rotor disk location, measured without the rotor installed, provides the complete linear inflow boundary condition to this problem.\",\n                \"A major goal of the larger study is to develop more accurate prediction methods for an open rotor ingesting turbulence.  discusses the methodology for computing the far field sound spectrum generated by a rotor ingesting turbulence. The authors show that to predict the far field sound spectra, the blade loading correlation and upwash velocity correlation function are required. The upwash velocity is the velocity perpendicular to the blades of a rotor disk, and its correlation function directly depends on the two-point time delay correlation function of the inflow. The two-point time delay correlation function is also important in the larger study because it can be used to calculate the dominate eddy structures present in a flow. Identifying coherent structures in the wake flow is of interest to the larger study because the broadband noise generated by a rotor blade can be broken down into predictions of the noise generated by individual characteristic eddies of the flow.\",\n                \"This thesis discusses the structure of the undisturbed cylinder wake in terms of its turbulence statistics and two-point time delay correlation.

The two-point correlation functions in each wake flow were used to infer the characteristic eddy structures in each wake using proper orthogonal decomposition. The comparisons between the cylinder and airfoil wake data sets show some similarities, but also some significant differences. Most surprisingly, the two wakes were found to have quite similar mean flows while at the same time supporting markedly different turbulence structures. This comparison is significant to the larger study because a cylinder may not always be the best representation of a real word turbulence ingestion scenario. For example, an airfoil wake would be a better inflow condition for an aircraft with rear-mounted control surfaces and a rear mounted propeller. The comparisons between the structures of the cylinder and airfoil turbulent wake flows will give insight into how and why these different inflow conditions will produce different sound fields when an open rotor ingests either one of these wake flows.\"\n            ],\n            \"title\": \"Chapter 1: Introduction\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"paragraphs\": [\n                \"The wake behind a circular has been widely studied for its relative simplicity and inhomogeneity.

Fluid turbulence is a complex subject especially when applied to separated flow, jet noise, boundary layers and ingestion as described by .\",\n                \"It has been accepted that the flow over a circular cylinder produces periodic vortex shedding known as von Karman vortex streets.  performed an experimental study designed to characterize the development of the cylinder wake at Reynolds numbers between 40 and 10,000. The cylinder diameters ranged from 0.0235 to 0.635 cm and spanned the width of the 50 cm wind tunnel test section. Hotwire probes were used to measure the velocity fluctuations in the cylinder wake.  showed that there are three ranges in the cylinder wake: the stable range, transition range and the irregular range. In the stable range, between Reynolds numbers of 40 and 150 the classical stable vortex streets are formed and were observed in the experimental results. In the irregular range between Reynolds numbers of 300 and 10,000 the periodic vortex shedding is observed along with turbulent velocity fluctuations. In the stable range the large free vortices convect downstream and dissipate through viscous diffusion. In the so called irregular range the free vortices contain turbulent fluid and thus diffuse faster. Roshko states that the measured wake became fully turbulent 40 to 50 cylinder diameters downstream.\",\n                \"The work of better understanding the flow behind a cylinder was continued by  who aimed to better understand the dimensionality of the wake.

Measurements were made at a Reynolds number based on cylinder diameter of 3900. Gerrard presented Reynolds stress profiles and autospectra and ultimately concluded that the very near wake is two-dimensional. The experiments also showed that for larger streamwise separations three-dimensional effects result from the occurrence of laminar and turbulent vortices at the same time at different positions along the cylinder span. This shows that the three-dimensional flow around a two dimensional body is complicated where two-dimensional flow only exists in the very near wake.\",\n                \"Understanding the turbulent structures present in wake flows was continued by the work of . Townsend performed measurements at a cylinder diameter Reynolds number of 8000 and at a streamwise station 170 diameters downstream of the cylinder. He studied the coherent organized eddy structures in turbulent shear flows by recording velocity fluctuations in the flow. He found that the eddy life cycle from generation to decay makes it difficult to determine a single eddy structure using eigenfunction analysis since the characteristic eddy will be assumed combination of eddies at different stages in its life cycle. To obtain a better description of the wake eddies one half of the wake must be sampled such that the eddy structures can be computed over this range.\",\n                \"Wake flows have also been studied in more recent times. The structure of the near field wake was further investigated in a PIV study performed by . The goal of this study was to measure the structure of the wake to use for simulation validation. A 1.4 cm cylinder was placed in a wind tunnel test section 670 mm x 670 mm. The aspect ratio of the cylinder in this study was 4.8. PIV measurements taken between 0.5 and 2.5 diameters downstream at a Reynolds number based on cylinder diameter and freestream velocity of 140 000. The measurements reveal a symmetric pattern in velocity and an antisymmetric pattern in velocity due to the averaging of alternating eddies. This caused a similar asymmetry in the Reynolds shear stress as shown by  who studied the wake of circular and square cylinders at streamwise locations of 1.25, 2.5 and 5 diameters in a water tunnel at a Reynolds number based on side length and upstream velocity of 5 715. In both studies The streamlines show a strong recirculation region directly downstream of the cylinder. The full Reynolds stress tensor was computed in each study and yielded similar results.  also investigated the two-point correlation using the streamwise and transverse velocity components. The study showed that as the correlation center moves downstream the size of the correlation structure becomes wider. The correlation in the transverse direction is stretched perpendicular to the wake as the center moves downstream.\",\n                \"Recent studies have been performed where understanding the wake flow in detail is necessary for understanding the noise produced by a wake generator. Noise reduction has become increasingly important in the design of new and existing commercial and military flight vehicles. It is important to study how this noise is generated from two dimensional bodies such as cylinder so that it can be reduced.  investigated the sound pressure level (SPL) changes with respect to aspect ratio and inclined angle of a circular cylinder. The work attributed the change in SPL to changes in the vortex structure of the wake. Hotwire measurements were performed in a low noise wind tunnel 1.25 diameters downstream for cylinder diameter Reynolds numbers between 300 and 20,000. The wake study concluded that the influence on the spanwise structure in the wake becomes greater as the aspect ratio decreases and the inclined angle increases. They also found that as the inclination angle increases the spanwise wake structures are highly influenced by the bottom wall. The von Karman vortex street becomes stronger in the direction of the cylinder axis as the inclination angle increases, . As the inclination increases the vortex street structure begins to break down. These flow structure observations were made using the hydrogen bubble flow visualization technique in a closed circuit water tunnel at a cylinder diameter Reynolds number of 450.

Many authors have investigated wake flows shed from different generators and evaluated whether wakes shed by different generators can be considered universal. The earliest ideas of self-preservation are those of . Townsend hypothesized that sufficiently far downstream of the wake generator the wake reaches a state where it can be described by a single velocity scale, the deficit velocity given by , and a single length scale, the half wake width given by . The deficit velocity is defined by the difference between the freestream and the minimum velocity on the wake centerline. The half wake width is defined as the distance between the wake centerline and the location of half the deficit velocity. These variables have been used by many authors to scale wakes generated from different bodies to assess the universality of wake flows. .1 shows the selfpreserving plane wake and highlights the half wake width and deficit velocity. This description of the wake and its scaling variables is described by . Self-preservation or self-similarity implies that the mean velocity and Reynolds stress profiles are independent of the streamwise location when normalized o n and .  measured the wakes behind an airfoil, a cylinder, a solid strip and a 70% solid screen. The solid strip and screen were specially designed to have wakes with the same momentum thickness as the cylinder at a cylinder diameter Reynolds number of 4 000. Reynolds numbers ranged from 1 360 to 6 500 for each model tested.  found that the velocity and length scales, and respectively, were indeed dependent on the wake generator. The geometry of the generator had a significant effect on the scales when normalized on the momentum thickness and the free-stream velocity of each flow. This implies that no universal behavior was observed in these quantities determine in the wake flows of different generators. Although and were not similar for different generators, the mean velocity profiles normalized on the deficit velocity and the half wake width were nearly identical for each generator.  also found that the turbulence intensities in each wake were nearly self-preserving sufficiently downstream of the generator. Although the Reynolds stresses were nearly self-similar for each individual generator, the stress profiles measured behind different generators showed significant variation in magnitude. The wake growth rates behind each generator also varied significantly. For example, the airfoil wake had a larger growth in the same normalized streamwise distance than the growth rate seen in the flows behind the solid strip and turbulence screen, although each wake was individually self-preserving. This further suggests that turbulence is not completely universal.  confirmed and further argued that there are no simple conclusions for the selfpreservation of turbulent wakes. George acknowledges that wake flows reach a preserving state downstream of a wake generator and that some believe that all plane wakes should evolve independently of their generators. George reviewed two decades of experimental work to reach the conclusion in some cases a wake can become self-preserving and independent of the generator while in some cases the wake structure is strongly dependent on generator. Direct numerical simulations of three different plane wakes performed by  further confirmed the findings from the study performed by . The wakes were simulated using two realizations of a turbulent boundary layer each at a momentum thickness Reynolds number of 670. The two boundary layers were used to produce a simulation for a zero thickness flat plate at zero angle of attack. To account for the two-dimensional disturbances in a plane wake such as the von Karman vortex street, forcing was added to the simulations. Two wakes each with excitation (strong and weak) and one unforced wake were studied. The forcing was applied to the flows by amplifying the two-dimensional modes in the initial condition in the streamwise and wake-normal velocity components. This resulted in an uncontrolled disturbance that did not have a characteristic streamwise wavelength ). In the case of the weakly forced wake the fluctuations were amplified by a factor of 5 while in the strongly forced wake the fluctuations were amplified by a factor of 20. Moser ultimately concluded that the mean streamwise velocity profiles of three wake flows were similar when normalized on the deficit velocity and half wake width. The Reynolds stress profiles normalized on these variables did not show any agreement and thus were not universal. Moser showed that there was better agreement when the stress profiles were normalized on wake growth rate in addition to the deficit velocity. This suggests that the half wake and deficit velocity cannot be used to solely assess the preservation of wakes shed by different generators, since the growth rates of different wakes can be significantly different.\",\n                \"More recently  also investigated only self-preservation in the wake of a circular cylinder at a cylinder diameter and freestream velocity Reynolds number of 2000. Measurements were performed at streamwise stations between 20 and 601 diameters. The study showed as previous have before it that the mean velocity deficit and Reynolds stress do indeed exhibit selfsimilar behavior for a single geometry and some location downstream of the generator. The energy spectra were also self-preserving when normalized on the half wake and deficit velocity. The authors state the effect of initial conditions such as the geometry of the generator cannot be ruled out as they have only considered the wake from one generator. This agrees with the authors work presented here. George (2012) revisits the idea of universality of wakes flow and came to the same conclusion as his previous work discussed in . George again ended his review by stating that the upstream generator conditions indeed do matter, where in some flows the geometry has a greater influence on the wake structure than in others.\"\n            ],\n            \"title\": \"Universality and Self-Preservation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"paragraphs\": [\n                \"Turbulent fluid flow is an important subject in the aerodynamic and aeroacoustic fields and is still perhaps one of the least understood. It seems that since the physical laws of fluid flows are well understood and described by the Naiver-Stokes equations and that over a century of complex experiments have been performed and discussed, this flow should be well defined in the analytical and computational sense. However it is still difficult to model turbulent flow for even simple geometries at high Reynolds numbers as described by  due to the nonlinearity of the governing equations. Another complication is that the experimental and mathematical data show that turbulence involves the interaction of many degrees of freedom over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales as described by . One approach is to reduce the complexity of the flow by removing the nonessential degrees of freedom. According to , Liu (1986) was among the first to suggest that this reduction of complexity was possible and document the experimental discovery of coherent structures.  reviewed an extensive amount of experimental studies investigating coherent structures, which lead to the definition given by . Coherent structures are organized spatial features that repeatedly appear and have a characteristic temporal life cycle.

The proper orthogonal decomposition is a mathematical method of extracting basis functions for a modal decomposition of a set of signals. The mathematical basis is described by  and . POD was used in turbulence by  where second order statistics were used to extract large scale structures from turbulent flow. The velocity fluctuation components are used to compute the second order statistics, or the two-point time delay correlation, needed to perform a POD analysis. This twopoint correlation can be computed by correlating the velocity components between two velocity probes, or using laser diagnostic methods. POD is a popular method especially in the application of turbulence since it is a purely mathematical procedure. The POD method does not need assumptions of linearity in order to compute the modes that describe the turbulent structures. The method is as blind and as general as Fourier analysis . POD works by describing turbulence in terms of a set of orthogonal modes by maximizing the energy of the modes where the eigenvalues correspond to the kinetic energy of the modes ). There have been many experimental studies performed with the intention of using POD to characterize the turbulent structures.  and  were among the first to apply POD techniques to boundary layer flows.  and  applied POD methods to investigate jet flows and Payne and  used POD to investigate the large eddy structures in wake flows.\",\n                \"Proper orthogonal decomposition has been a useful tool for identifying the shape of eddy structures more recently in different turbulent flows.  used PIV to measure a square cylinder wake 1, 3.5 and 6 diameters downstream of the cylinder. The data was used to compute the two-point correlation and ultimately the POD modes at each streamwise location at a Reynolds number of 9,300. They found that more than half of the TKE was in the first POD mode which represents the vortex shedding. The near wake is dominated by the first two modes, which shows alternately arranged vortices organized in a coherent street. They found that a flow structure could be described qualitatively and quantitatively using POD coefficients.  showed that a novel LDV system could also be used to compute the two-point correlation in a wake at a cylinder diameter Reynolds number of 1200.  made PIV measurements in the near wall region of a turbulent channel flow at a Reynolds number based on channel half width of 6600. Both authors computed two point velocity statistics and performed a POD to gain insight into the eddy structures present in the flow. Two point correlation functions are also relevant to numerical simulations.  created a system that used the full two-point correlation function of a channel flow for a given aspect ratio and Reynolds number to generate inlet turbulence models for channels of different aspect ratio and Reynolds numbers.

POD is especially useful when predicting the sound produced by a turbulent flow interacting with rigid surfaces, such as in the present study.  used compact eddy structures, defined as the projection of the POD modes onto the correlation function, to describe the sound radiated from a fan rotor. This approach eliminates the need for turbulence modeling by assuming a form of the turbulence spectrum. The modes were computed using the cross correlation function estimated from the Reynolds stresses and the wake width.  found that proper orthogonal modes are a better approach than spectral analysis for inhomogeneous flows. The POD of a time stationary flow can be given in terms compact eddy structures which represents the time averaged flow structure. The sound radiated from a particular interaction can then be related to specific features of the flow, where the dominant eddy structures account for most of the sound produced from the interaction between turbulence and rigid surfaces.

It would be unrealistic to schedule a dedicated test entry in the SWT for the time required to complete a measurement of this scale. The size of the open circuit tunnel also made the probe mounting and traverse systems simpler. In the Stability Wind Tunnel, the probes would have needed to traverse far greater distances due to the test section size. A simpler probe setup is also favored to avoid probe collisions and vibrations in the probe mounts.\"\n            ],\n            \"title\": \"Open Circuit Wind Tunnel Test Entry\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"paragraphs\": [\n                \"The Open Circuit Wind Tunnel (OCWT) is powered by a 30 hp BC -SW Size 395 Twin City centrifugal fan controlled by an AF-600 General Electric variable frequency drive.

This error is likely due to an inconsistency in the test section setup where a wall panel or a corner fillet in the test section changed before the last five measurements were completed. This could have caused the wake to shift inside the test section. A second possibility is that a physical misalignment was introduced into the traverse system where each position was then offset by some amount.

In this measurement grid the RMS voltages near the negative side of the wake are closer to zero than for RMS voltages shown .37.

This extra error arises when determining the correction needed to resolve the true flow velocities using the angle calibration. As discussed in Section 2.3.3, the angle calibration defines the error in the measured velocity components for any probe pitch and yaw angle within \\u00b145 degrees. .39 shows the error in the quad-hotwire measured velocity as a percentage of the freestream velocity during calibration for pitch and yaw angles ranging from -45 to 45 degrees. The structure of the error contour is such that at zero probe pitch and yaw, the error in the velocity is very near zero. As the probe pitch or yaw angle changes, the error in velocity begins to change rapidly. The angle calibration is ultimately computed by fitting a surface to the velocity errors shown in .39. Since the cylinder wake flow is unidirectional, only a single point on the calibration surface is used to correct the measured velocity at a single measurement point. When the probe pitch and yaw is large, the measurement is located at a point on the calibration surface where the gradient of the error is steep. In areas with a steep gradient in the velocity errors, the uncertainty in the surface fit is greater than for points that do not lie on such a steep gradient. This added uncertainty in the surface fit causes the velocity components corrected using the angle calibration to resolve the velocity components with some added error. This error due to the measurement location on the angle calibration surface does not affect the measured mean flow, but does influence the Reynolds stresses. In the Stability Wind Tunnel wake measurements the hotwire probes used were never misaligned with the flow due to the nature of the single point wake profile measurements. This error due to the probe positioning in the Open Circuit facility could therefore be reduced by using the wake data measured when the probes were aligned in the Stability Wind Tunnel to correct for the error in the angle calibration surface fit. The cylinder wake mean streamwise velocities scaled on the deficit velocity and half wake width measured in the two facilities match closely shown above in .20. The Reynolds stress profiles also nearly matched as shown in .21 through .24. This agreement in the profiles measured in each facility makes it reasonable to use the profiles measured when the probes were aligned with the freestream to correct the profiles measured when the probes angled in the two-point measurement. A linear correction matrix was computed using the Reynolds stress profiles measured when the hotwire probes were aligned and misaligned with the freestream.

The modal profiles for the first four modes are shown in .58 through .61. The velocity profiles are plotted against the wake-normal variable normalized on the half wake width. These profiles represent the optimum modal velocity profiles for each component. For the first four modes the profiles in each direction are similar for each velocity component, and no one component appears to dominate.

The time delay correlation for zero probe separation was extracted from the two-point correlation function of each wake and plotted as coefficients in .75 for the cylinder wake and .76 for the airfoil wake. The correlation coefficients are plotted for normalized time delays between \\u221220 and 20 in the cylinder wake and for time delays between -8 and 8 in the airfoil wake at the wake center where = 0. It is clear that the cylinder wake is correlated to greater time delays in the and velocity components. In the airfoil wake the correlation coefficient in the component of velocity component decays rapidly toward zero. In the cylinder wake the correlation also decays toward zero, however the correlation is sustained at greater time delays. In the correlation coefficient in the component of velocity there is strong oscillation in the cylinder wake due to the vortex shedding in the cylinder wake. In the airfoil wake there is some oscillation, however the motion is quickly damped. This shows that there is stronger and more coherent shedding in the cylinder wake since the oscillation in the correlation coefficient is sustained to a significantly greater normalized time delay of \\u00b120.

The wake normal coordinate is expressed as a separation from the fixed probe for each correlation component. In each figure the correlations computed using the cylinder and airfoil wakes are plotted side by side on equivalent axes limits from -3 to 3 in the and \\u0394 directions, but on different color scales. In each figure, the correlations are plotted with 10 contour levels.

In the following comparisons significant correlation at large separations was defined as a correlation value larger than 1% of the maximum correlation seen in a specific component.  .79 show the two point correlations for zero time delay for the streamwise, wake-normal and spanwise velocity components respectively. Both the cylinder wake and airfoil wake correlation components show similar structures. In each correlation component there is a region where the correlation is maximum near zero and separation. The correlation value then decreases toward zero as the separation in either direction is increased. In each of the normal correlation components the region where the cylinder wake has significant positive correlation extends past that seen in the airfoil wake. This is likely due to the stronger and more coherent vortices shed by the cylinder. This also implies that the length scales are longer in the cylinder wake. In the and directions the center of the correlation structure appears to be offset towards the positive \\u0394 direction. This offset is toward the fixed probe and is observed in both wakes. In the correlations for both wake flows, the and are correlated at larger separations in the negative \\u0394 direction. In the wake normal direction the correlation is spans larger and separations in the cylinder wake, about 5 half wake widths. In both wakes the correlation spans the shortest range of and separations and is stretched along the cylinder span.  .85 compare the two point correlations computed using other velocity component combinations between the fixed and moving probes. These correlations are the off diagonal terms in the two-point correlation tensor. In each of these figures the magnitude of the maxima of the correlation in the cylinder wake are closer to the maxima of the correlations in the airfoil wake than previously seen in the normal correlation component directions. For each cross correlation the maximum correlation value between both wakes are within about 50% of each other where in the normal correlations the maximum correlation seen in the cylinder wake is 2-4 times greater than in the airfoil wake. This is also observed in .73 above where the Reynolds shear stress profiles in the cylinder and airfoil wakes were closer in magnitude than the normal stresses. The Reynolds shear stress level seen in the cylinder wake is about 2 times greater than in the airfoil wake while the normal stress levels in the cylinder wake are 2-4 times greater in the cases of and while is about 10 times greater than the levels of the stress profiles in the airfoil wake. .80 compares the correlation computed using the streamwise velocity component from the fixed probe and the wake-normal velocity component from the moving probe, . In the direction the cylinder wake is correlated over a larger distance, about 4.6 half wake widths, while the airfoil wake is only correlated over about 3.9 half wake widths. In the spanwise direction the correlations extend the same distance, about 1.6 half wake widths, at the wake center. The center of the correlation structure where the correlation is highest is slightly skewed in the cylinder wake where the center is about 0.5 half wake widths from zero and separation. In the airfoil wake the correlation structure is centered near zero and separation. The cylinder wake also shows more skew toward the positive separation side of the wake whereas the in the airfoil wake the correlation is reasonably symmetric. The signs of the correlation are equivalent in each wake. .81 compares the correlation component . In this case the cylinder wake is correlated over the entire spatial range considered for comparison. The signs of the correlations are again equivalent, however the cylinder wake features larger correlation lobes when the probe separation in the direction is negative. In the cylinder wake correlation the lobes centered in the positive \\u0394 side of the wake appear to extend into the side of the wake where the separation is negative. In the airfoil wake correlation there is a clear separation of the lobes for positive and negative probe separations. The centers of the lobes seen in the cylinder wake are located at noticeably larger separations than seen in the airfoil wake. In the cylinder wake the lobes on the positive separation of the wake are located at 1.2 half wake widths in and \\u00b10.7 half wake widths in while the center of the lobes in the airfoil wake occur at 0.35 half wake widths in and \\u00b10.4 half wake widths in delta The same is true in the negative separation side of the wakes were the center of the lobes in the cylinder wake are located at \\u0394/ = \\u22121.7 and \\u0394/ = \\u00b11.2 while in the airfoil wake the centers occur at delta / = \\u22120.55 and \\u0394/ = \\u00b10.7. The alternating signs of the lobes occur due to the alternate vortex shedding nature of the cylinder. This comparison of the location of the alternating lobes suggest that the structures shed by the cylinder remain coherent at larger and separations. .82 compares the correlation component between wakes. In this component both wakes show a skew in the negative \\u0394 direction in the wake. The cylinder wake shows significantly larger correlation region and a heavier skew toward the negative \\u0394 direction. In this component the maximum of each correlation is located at zero and separations. The cylinder wake is correlated at larger and separations in the negative \\u0394 region of the wake. On the positive \\u0394 side of the wake the correlations in each wake are correlated to equal distances in \\u0394. The cylinder wake is correlated at larger separations to about \\u0394/ = 1.8 while the airfoil wake is only correlated to \\u0394/ = 1. .83 compares the correlation component. The same alternating sign behavior of the correlation component is seen in the correlation component. In this comparison the center of the cylinder and airfoil wake correlation structures appear to be centered near zero and separations. The cylinder wake correlation is again better correlated over greater separations. The correlation in the airfoil wake is biased in the negative \\u0394 direction where as the cylinder wake correlation seems to be evenly distributed between the positive and negative \\u0394 directions. In the port half of the wake the center of the lobes in both wakes appear to both occur at and / separations of 0.5. In the starboard half of the wake the lobes in the cylinder wake appear to be centered at the point = / = 1 while in the airfoil wake the lobes in the starboard side of the wake appear to be centered at the location = / = 0.5. In the cylinder wake correlation it appears that these regions are connected to form a single correlation region surrounding the lobes located at the wake center. In the direction significant correlation exists in the cylinder wake at greater separations. On the negative \\u0394 side of the wake the cylinder wake is correlated for separations up to \\u00b13 / . The comparison in the correlation component again shows that the cylinder wake is better correlated in the and directions. .85 compares for each wake. The cylinder wake correlation shows correlated regions that alternate in sign throughout the wake. In the airfoil wake correlation there are only two main lobes that extend into the negative separation side of the wake. In this component of the correlation function the cylinder wake is correlated on both sides of the wake, over the range \\u22122 < \\u0394/ < 1.5, while the airfoil wake is best correlated on the negative \\u0394 side of the wake over the range, 0 < \\u0394/ < \\u22123.

The first mode contains about 53% of the total kinetic energy. In the airfoil wake the first mode accounts for 48% of the total energy of all of the modes.

The airfoil wake does show complex profile shapes in the and velocities. In the fifth and sixth modes the airfoil wake only shows nonzero profiles in the velocity component while the cylinder wake shows nonzero profiles for all three velocity components. It is important to recall that the modal profiles are ordered only by eigenvalue. .88 shows that the eigenvalues for modes three to six are relatively similar in the cylinder wake flow.

Both correlations were computed over the range of \\u00b1 3 in / and in / . In each wake the correlation is expressed as a coefficient to plot the correlations on equivalent scales. The correlation plots show similar features in each component of the correlation. The correlation is largest in each wake, although in the cylinder wake the correlation extends a greater distance in and . At first glance it appears that the airfoil wake maintains a maximum correlation over a greater distance than the cylinder wake, indicated by the constant color level on the center diagonal of the normal correlations. However, the ridge of maximum correlation in the cylinder wake normal correlations is maintained over an equal distance in each normal direction. .89 shows that cylinder wake is correlated at greater and locations indicated by correlation coefficient values greater than 0.1 in the cylinder wake correlation at greater probe separations.  .90 shows that there is strong similarity in the eddy structure first mode, which contains the most energy for both wakes. The dominant feature the velocity field of each wake is a strong down wash at zero time delay. The analysis shows that cylinder wake has only counter-rotating vortices that appear singularly at positive and negative time delays while the airfoil wake sees additional counter rotating paired vortices at positive time delays. The cylinder wake also shows eddies with larger diameters. In .91 the second mode is compared for both wakes. Again, there are some similarities in the eddy structures.

Further investigation is needed to assess how these differences in the flow structures will influence the predicted sound profiles computed using the cylinder and airfoil two-point correlation functions.\"\n            ],\n            \"title\": \"Chapter 4: Conclusions\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"paragraphs\": [\n                \"In      \"\n            ],\n            \"title\": \"Appendix B: The Correction of the Open Circuit Wind Tunnel Reynolds Stress Profiles\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"paragraphs\": [\n                \"The correlation comparisons for \\u2044 = 1 are discussed in Section 3.3.3.    \"\n            ],\n            \"title\": \"C.3 Zero Time Delay Correlation Comparison for an Anchor Point of \\u2044 =\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"id\": 17292,\n    \"title\": \"The Two Point Correlation Structure of a Cylinder Wake The Two Point Correlation Structure of a Cylinder Wake The Two Point Correlation Structure of a Cylinder Wake\",\n    \"type\": \"thesis\"\n}\n"
